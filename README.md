MAREU is an app who helps you create new meetings and helps you follow each of them, sorting them by room and dates.
In this app, you can create a meeting, adding the name of the meeting room, the date and the time of the meeting, the subject and finally the participants.
When you need to see which room is booked or which meetings are planned on a specific date, you can use the simple filter.
